# FaceSecurity
### Hack The North 2019
*An all in one remote door / venue security system that can identify close friends, or intruders, and chose whether to open the door without the need for your intervention.*

FaceSecurity uses your social interaction on Facebook and Messenger to see who your friends are, and categorizes their permissions to access your dorm, apartment, or house with one simple message on Messenger. It can also pick times where certain people can come in, tell you which one of your friends from Facebook is at the door, or if it's a random stranger.

## What I did:

 - Developed an IoT security door that will unlock using facial recognition, a machine learning database, Raspberry Pi, PiCamera, AWS Rekognition, Node.js, Messenger API & Facebook Graph API

 - Configured the Node.js Heroku server and utilized JavaScript and JSON objects to create the Messenger service that will notify the homeowner based on the guestâ€™s face from RESTful GET & POST requests


## Inspiration
Ever been stuck in a meeting, test, or don't have cell service? Want to ensure that your kids are safe, not leaving the house, or not letting anyone in? Has your friend ever forgot anything at your house and asked to get it while you are out? FaceSecurity solves all these problems.

## What it does
FaceSecurity uses your social interaction on Facebook and Messenger to see who your friends are, and categorizes their permissions to access your dorm, apartment, or house with one simple message on Messenger. It can also pick times where certain people can come in, tell you which one of your friends from Facebook is at the door, or if its a random stranger.

## How we built it
We used a Raspberry Pi + PiCamera to run a python script that uses the Graph API to grab images and names of your Facebook friends. It then builds a collection of user entries and uploads them to the AWS Recognition platform. Whenever someone comes to your door the lock queries the collection to identify if if the visitor is one of your close friends, distant friends, or a stranger on Facebook. A Node.js script runs on Heroku to handle the messenger calls to tell you who is at the door, and to grant them access or not. A servo control the doors lock and only activates it if the friend is in a special "allowed in" category.

## Challenges we ran into
We first tried to run a python script that sends the image of the person at the door to a JS server that would then query the AWS ML, however sending the image was a large issue so we changed to handle all of that on the Rpi.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of being able to merge hardware, software and 3D printing to create a product with an intuitive use case.

## What's next for FaceSecurity
Initiate face calls when strangers are at the door, and better friend permission management.
